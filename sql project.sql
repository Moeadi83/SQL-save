The Situation: I have joined Judah Inc., a company specializing in computer hardware sales to large businesses, as a sales analyst.
The Vice President of Sales is generally satisfied with her team's performance but seeks a clearer understanding of its strengths and weaknesses.
I have been tasked with analyzing last year's sales, including key statistics on the sales pipeline's health and sales agent performance.
I will also assess product popularity and customer profiles.

GTXPRO return to Null because in Sales_pipeline table GTXPRO is written with no space
however in products GTX PRO is written with space. Data Engineer will need to fix this.
